# Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts

**Kaggle Â· Playground Prediction Competition**

[**Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 7**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e7)

## Overview

**Welcome to the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series!** We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting and approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

**Your Goal:** Your objective is to predict whether a person is an Introvert or Extrovert, given their social behavior and personality traits.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using **Accuracy Score** between the predicted value and the observed target.

## Submission File

For each `id` in the test set, you must predict the target `Personality`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```csv
id,Personality
18524,Extrovert
18525,Introvert
18526,Introvert
etc.
```

## Dataset Description

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

**Note** - This is a relatively small dataset, so a one to use for comparing different modeling approaches, making visualization, etc.

### Files

- **train.csv** - the training dataset; `Personality` is the categorical target
- **test.csv** - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the `Personality` for each row
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
